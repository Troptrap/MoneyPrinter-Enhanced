1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,356
Paying

2
00:00:00,356 --> 00:00:00,830
off your

3
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,305
mortgage

4
00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:01,602
early

5
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:01,899
might

6
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:02,433
seem like

7
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:02,848
a smart

8
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:03,383
financial

9
00:00:03,383 --> 00:00:04,392
decision.

10
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:04,930
However,

11
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,536
there are

12
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:06,008
several

13
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:06,479
reasons

14
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:06,883
why it

15
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:07,355
may not

16
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:07,759
be the

17
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,028
best

18
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:08,904
idea.

19
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:09,328
Firstly,

20
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:09,806
you could

21
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:10,230
miss out

22
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,549
on the

23
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:11,132
opportunity

24
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:11,610
to invest

25
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:11,822
your

26
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:12,087
money

27
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:12,565
elsewhere

28
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:12,724
and

29
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,308
potentially

30
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:13,520
earn

31
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:13,839
higher

32
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,210
returns

33
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,635
than the

34
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:15,059
interest

35
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:15,430
rate on

36
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,643
your

37
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:17,076
mortgage.

38
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:17,637
By paying

39
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:18,135
off your

40
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:18,634
mortgage

41
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:19,133
quickly,

42
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:19,507
you're

43
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:20,193
essentially

44
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:20,629
locking

45
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:20,878
away

46
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:21,190
funds

47
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,439
that

48
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:21,751
could

49
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,312
have been

50
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:22,811
used for

51
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,123
other

52
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,744
investments.

53
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:25,456
Secondly,

54
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,010
keeping

55
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,327
your

56
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:26,960
mortgage

57
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,197
can

58
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:27,752
provide

59
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:27,989
tax

60
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,256
benefits.

61
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:29,676
In many

62
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:30,277
countries,

63
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:30,818
including

64
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:31,298
Nigeria,

65
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,899
homeowners

66
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,079
can

67
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,440
deduct

68
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:32,740
their

69
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,221
mortgage

70
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:33,702
interest

71
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:33,942
from

72
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:34,242
their

73
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:34,663
taxable

74
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:35,084
income,

75
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:35,564
reducing

76
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:35,865
their

77
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:36,285
overall

78
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:36,465
tax

79
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:37,968
burden.

80
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:38,299
If you

81
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,687
pay off

82
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:38,908
your

83
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:39,350
mortgage

84
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,682
early,

85
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:40,125
you lose

86
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:40,401
these

87
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:40,899
potential

88
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,065
tax

89
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:42,006
savings.
